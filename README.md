## The Story Behind This Program
This was my first C++ program. A friend of mine (@ilham-daiee-muntahi) helped me with the procedure. Both me and Ilham learned the process of finding out the day from another friend of ours, Afia Farzana Priontee. The idea of making a program on that comes from Ilham's head. He created the program in his own way. I also created the program in my own style.

I first released the alpha version of the program on March 28, 2020. But it had timeline restrictions.

On April 2, I finally made the fully-functional version of the program. It worked unless the value of the 'year' variable was greater than or equal to 1600 and less than 2200. I was so happy that I started to try out every special date I could remember (even June 23, 1757). Then I made the second release (I named that beta, lol).

> Note: I didn't know I missed the `return 0;` statement!

Finally, on April 11, 2021, I released the first stable version of the program. In this version, I tried to minimize the code as much as I could. But I do believe it could be made more efficient.

## Try It Out!
Check out the [releases]: https://github.com/shuddho-sharaf/Daydream/releases page to download the latest release. The program was compiled with the GNU G++ compiler and currently, it won't run on your machine if your machine is not running on **Windows**.

## Contribute
Well, I think I need to work more on this thing and so I'm not leaving the source code just yet. But you are welcome to open an issue and inform me about "The Issues" in this program.

## Don't thank me!
I already mentioned the major contributors. So, thank them, not me.
**Syonara!**
