# Daydream

## The Story Behind This Program
This program is a part of my C++ journey. I never thought that I would write a program that can tell me the day, based on the date but I eventually made it! I got my inspirations from **Ilham Daiee Muntahi**, a great friend of mine. Man, you really helped me a lot with the procedure and exit system. I'm also grateful to **Afia Farzana Priontee** for teaching me the algorithm. This is a cool thing that I have learnt from you. Thanks to you guys!

## Try It Out!
Check out the [releases](https://github.com/shuddho-sharaf/Daydream/releases) page to download the latest release. Currently, the program is only usable on 64 bit Windows.

## Contribute
The [source code](https://github.com/shuddho-sharaf/Daydream/tree/main/src) is available. If you want to tweak it then go for it!

## Don't thank me!
I already mentioned the major contributors. So, thank them, not me.

**Syonara!**
